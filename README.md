# Neural-Symbolic-Computing
`model_params.pyt` contains the saved model, will be automatically downloaded
if `LOAD` under `Test`is set to `True`.
In case one wants to just load the model, just execute all cells
except the ones under `Training` and `Loss progression` then use the cells under
`Test` to test the model for different inputs.

to train and test the trained model, please set `LOAD=False` under `Test`
for testing the (newly) trained model.
